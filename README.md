This project performs Meta Learning + Federated Learning on datasets with very large number of parameters.
This file is designed to run on either Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook as the upload file widget is present in the output of this program. The links for both the websites are given below:

1) Google Colab:- https://colab.research.google.com
2) Jupyter Notebook Installation Link:- https://jupyter.org/install




Project Structure

1] Study 1

(Using All the parameters)

Correlation matrix ----->
Baseline models of ML ----->
K-fold validation ----->
Concatenate the results ----->

Meta-model, 
Voting 

Last prediction


2] Study 2
(Using some parameters - set 1
Using some parameters - set 2)

Correlation matrix ----->
Dimensionality - PCA, etc. ----->
Baseline models of ML ----->
